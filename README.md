# ITO4131

## What's in this repository?

This repository contains the code for the assignments and rolling project of the course ITO4131 - Java Programming at Monash University. But it _does not_ contain the code for the final project.

## Contents

### Code Challenges

Each week we were given a few code challenges to complete, based on what we would be learning that week. These are located in the `Code Challenges` folder.

### Sandbox

The sandbox folder contains a few small programs that I wrote to test out some concepts that I was learning. These are not necessarily related to any of the assignments or code challenges (although some are.)

It's really just a folder I used to put random code I was working on and things I thought were interesting and wanted to try.

### Rolling Project

The rolling project is a project that we worked on throughout the semester. It was a simple text-based University enrolment system. Each week we were given a new requirement to add to the project.

It has functionality to:

- Add students
- Add courses
- Enrol students in courses
- View student details
- View course details
- View enrolment details
- Read all of the above from a file to create enrolments
- Write all of the above to a file to save enrolments

The final version of the rolling project is located in the `Rolling Project` folder.
